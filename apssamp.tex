\begin{abstract} 
Constraining the period between the dark ages and reionization has recently emerged as one of the challenges of modern radio astronomy. The motivation behind this interest is the fact that there is a clear correlation between the key features of the global $21cm$ signal and underlying astrophysical properties of the high redshift Universe. These correlations can be used to directly link measurements of the global $21cm$ signal to astrophysical quantities. Moreover, the global $21cm$ signal is a novel probe of physics beyond the standard model of cosmology and astrophysics, and the majority of these proposed non-standard mechanisms are expected to leave their footprints on the value of physical parameters. Therefore, the urge to perform proper parameter estimation on the corresponding observational data is undeniable. In this work, we introduce \emph{G21cmFit}, an efficient Python package to estimate the astrophysical parameters of the global 21cm signal. This package takes advantage of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) combined with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to fit theoretical models to mock/experimental data of global $21cm$ signal.

\section{Background and Introduction}
Background: Briefly explain the significance of the global 21cm signal and its relevance in cosmology and astrophysics.\\
Motivation: Describe the need for accurate parameter estimation in studying the 21cm signal and the importance of an efficient Python package.\\
Objectives: Clearly state the goals of the paper and the specific contributions of the Python package.\\
outline of the paper\\
The global $21cm$ signal is the average over the brightness temperature of the $21cm$ line across the entire sky. It is a measure of the overall state of the \gls{igm} and presents itself as an excess absorption or emission in different redshift regions. This radiation is a piece of observational evidence for certain characteristics of the \gls{igm} in the early universe (e.g., temperature, density, and reionization state). These properties are determined by the complex interplay between the cosmic radiation field, the formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies, and the feedback processes that these sources exert on their surroundings\cite{21century}.\par
Besides all the above-mentioned applications, the global $21cm$ signal is a \textbf{strong probe for non-standard physics} during the dark ages and \gls{eor}. It has the potential to shed light on mysteries surrounding dark matter/dark energy, the existence of cosmic strings, and even certain particle interaction  \cite{dark_nature_21, constrain_dm_21, cosmic_string_brandenberger, ee_interaction_21, neutrino_21} \footnote{These effects will be discussed more in \ref{chap:global21cm,sub:non_standard}.}. This capacity of the global $21cm$ signal is the main motivation of this research.
